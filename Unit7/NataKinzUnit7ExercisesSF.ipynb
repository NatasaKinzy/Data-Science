There's an initial max at 295 and minimum at 263. It's then a bit straight and then becomes a concave down quadratic (a hump) at year 150-275. Then it goes fairly straight (imagine your hand is shaking while drawing a straight line) with a tiny slope upward. Then at year 1000-1350 there's another concave down hump that's fairly flat. Then there's a much steeper concave down hump from 1400-1600, and the graph slopes down and then waves up again at 1600ish. Then it becomes exponential from 1650-1900, timed with industrial revolution. Then it reaches new maximum of 333 and mininum 286 around 2050. Then it ends with the bottom of the hourglass with maximum of 324 and minimum of 275 around 2200 which hasn't happened yet so it's just predicting our future.**"
